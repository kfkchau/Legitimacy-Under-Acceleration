# **Issue 2 | The Metabolism of Rules: Why Governance Fails in a Fast World**
*Kelvin Chau*

## 1. What this is about

Governance, at its core, is **rule management**: deciding which rules exist, who they apply to, how they change, and how they’re enforced.

**Meta-governance** is the small set of rules *about* rule management: how we create, change, retire, and enforce rules.

This piece is about one simple idea:

> In a fast world, our rule management and meta-governance are too slow.

Rules don’t keep up with reality. Systems drift. People get hurt. Trust collapses.

I call this a **slow rule metabolism**.

By “metabolism of rules”, I mean how quickly and clearly a rule system:

- notices the world has changed  
- updates its assumptions  
- retires outdated rules  
- gets new rules all the way to the people and systems that use them  

When that metabolism is weak, governance fails — even if your policies look good on paper.

---

## 2. A fast world with a slow rule layer

In every domain, two things decide what actually happens:

1. The world changes — technology, markets, behaviour, shocks.  
2. Institutions respond — or don’t.

Breakdowns happen when:

- the **sensing side** (noticing reality has changed) is weak or ignored, and  
- the **decision side** (updating rules) is slow, opaque, or ad hoc.

That gap is what I mean by a **slow rule metabolism**.

You see the same pattern behind:

- market power that sticks long after conditions change  
- welfare or benefits systems that block people who should qualify  
- infrastructure projects that exist on paper but never connect in reality  

Different sectors, same failure shape.

## 3. Three warning signs your rule system is too slow

You don’t need theory to spot this. Look for these three signatures:

### 3.1 Rules keep piling up, but almost none are retired

- New directives and controls sit on top of old ones.  
- Contradictions are handled in meetings and work-arounds, not in the rulebook.

### 3.2 Patchwork governance

- You get “kitchen-sink” controls that try to cover everything.  
- No one can explain, in one page, what actually governs what.

### 3.3 Enforcement drift

- The logic for when and how to enforce is unclear.  
- The same situation gets different outcomes depending on who you talk to.  
- People start to feel: “this is discretionary and unfair”.

If you see those three together, you’re looking at a **slow, unhealthy rule metabolism**.

---

## 4. Two short examples (very different domains, same pattern)

### 4.1 UK Post Office “Horizon” scandal

- A faulty IT system made it look like hundreds of sub-postmasters were stealing.  
- Many were prosecuted and ruined.  
- Over years, contradictory evidence emerged: bugs, data issues, internal doubts.  
- Yet there was no forced process to revisit the core assumption: *“the system is always right”*.

**Result:**

- Massive human harm.  
- Loss of legitimacy.  
- Parliament eventually had to pass an extraordinary law to help clean up the mess.

**Pattern:** Enforcement stayed locked in while the evidence base moved.  
The rule metabolism had no way to force a re-check when signals from reality changed.

---

### 4.2 US generator interconnection backlog (FERC Order No. 2023)

- Developers trying to connect new generation (e.g. renewables) to the grid faced years-long queues.  
- Over time, more and more bespoke studies, steps, and conditions piled up.  
- Old steps were rarely removed; new ones were bolted on.  
- Responsibility for bottlenecks spread across committees, teams, and hand-offs.

**Result:**

- Delayed capacity.  
- Stranded investment.  
- A gap between energy policy goals and what actually got built.

**Pattern:** Process ossified; responsibility diffused.  
Again: **slow rule metabolism** — the rules of the queue didn’t evolve at the speed reality demanded.

## 5. The rule ecosystem: four roles and four critical links

To talk about fixing this, we need a simple map.

Four roles show up in every rule system:

- **Rule Environment**  
  The facts on the ground: data, behaviour, incentives, constraints, shocks.

- **Rule Makers**  
  People who design, draft, and maintain rules and guidance.

- **Decision Makers**  
  People or bodies who formally adopt, change, or retire rules — they hold authority and legitimacy.

- **Rule Users**  
  The people and systems who actually live under the rules: staff, contractors, the public, AI systems, processes.

A healthy metabolism depends on the **links between these roles**. Most failures happen at the edges.

Below are four critical edges, what they do, the warning signs, and questions you can ask right now.

---

### 5.1 Environment → Rule Makers (Sensing)

**What this link does**  
Turns real-world signals into “we might need to change something” on the rule side.

**Warning signs:**

- Important signals are ignored or trapped in silos.  
- People see problems on the ground but don’t have standing to trigger a rule review.  
- Data exists, but no one is tasked with looking at it through a “rules might be wrong” lens.

**Questions to ask:**

- What was the first signal that reality had changed?  
- Who saw it?  
- Did they have clear permission and a channel to say: *“this rule may now be wrong”*?

If you can’t answer that, your **sensing is weak**.

---

### 5.2 Rule Makers → Decision Makers (Rationale & options)

**What this link does**  
Turns “we have a problem” into clear options and a recommendation.

**Warning signs:**

- Decision makers get narrative memos without a clear evidence trail.  
- Options and impacts aren’t laid out systematically.  
- What gets escalated depends more on politics and personalities than on criteria.

**Questions to ask:**

- Between the first signal and the decision, what evidence and analysis can you still see on paper?  
- Could someone outside the room understand why this option was chosen?

If the only way to reconstruct the story is “ask the people who were there”, that link is weak.

---

### 5.3 Decision Makers → Rule Users (Authority & obligation)

**What this link does**  
Tells people what has changed, from a source they recognise as legitimate.

**Warning signs:**

- People find out about rule changes by rumour, chat, or forwarded emails.  
- Uptake is uneven: some units comply, others never see the change.  
- You hear “we didn’t know” in most reviews.

**Questions to ask:**

- Where can a rule user go to see:
  - which rules apply to them,  
  - what changed,  
  - when it changed, and  
  - who authorised it?

If there isn’t one clear, dated, accessible source, **legitimacy leaks out**.

---

### 5.4 Rule Makers → Rule Users (Operational guidance)

**What this link does**  
Translates rule text into “what do I do differently on Tuesday”.

**Warning signs:**

- The main artefact is a long PDF or policy email.  
- Guidance arrives after teams have already improvised their own approach.  
- Front-line staff or system owners give different answers when asked,  
  *“What does this rule actually mean for your work?”*

**Questions to ask:**

- Is there short, usable guidance that shows how the rule maps into day-to-day tasks, systems, and decisions?  
- Can two different teams explain the rule in the same way?

If not, the meaning degrades on the way from **rule text** to **execution**.

---

## 6. What good looks like: legible trails

In a robust rule ecosystem:

- You can trace a rule change across all four links **without interviewing anyone**.

You can point to:

- the signal from the environment  
- the analysis and options  
- the formal decision and authority  
- the guidance and changes in operation  

If you can’t do that — if you need a string of meetings and oral history to understand one change — you’re looking at:

- rules that keep accreting  
- almost no retirement  
- drifting, inconsistent enforcement  

That is a **slow rule metabolism**.

---

## 7. Why I talk about a “kernel”

In my research I describe a disciplined rule-change metabolism as a **meta-governance kernel**.

Practically, that means a small, explicit set of rules about how rules are:

- triggered for review  
- analysed  
- decided  
- communicated  
- enforced  

In other words, the **rules of rule management** — the meta-governance layer that sits underneath everything else.

I call my candidate kernel the **Universal Governance Lifecycle Standard (UGLS)**. You don’t need to learn the formal spec to use the idea.

The point of naming it is simple:

> When rule systems fail, what’s usually missing is not another checklist.  
> It’s a clear, shared way to change rules safely, visibly, and on purpose.

This piece is about **spotting the problem**.  
The kernel itself is the work to fix it.

---

## 8. Typical reactions (and how I look at them)

### “This sounds philosophical.”

Good. Then test it against reality:

- Bring actual documents from a real change: emails, memos, decisions.  
- See if you can follow the chain:  
  **signal → analysis → decision → guidance → practice**.

If you can, you already have a kernel.  
If you can’t, that’s what this is pointing at.

---

### “Too heavy for our context.”

You don’t need a big program to start:

- Pick one recent rule change or incident.  
- Ask the edge questions above.  
- Notice where the trail breaks.

That exercise alone often surfaces the main gaps.

---

### “We added more checklists.”

Checklists help, but:

> Checklists are not a metabolism.

Without a clear kernel and evidence trail:

- people tick boxes,  
- the underlying logic stays fuzzy,  
- and drift comes back as soon as pressure rises.

---

## 9. Close

If you like stress-testing ideas with first principles, try this:

- Take one real change from your world: a policy shift, a model change, a new control.  
- Use the four links and the questions above to see where your rule metabolism is strong and where it’s failing.

If you’ve lived this failure — in social policy, markets, safety, grids, or somewhere else — and you have real documents (good or bad), I’d value a co-review.

If you’re curious about the kernel itself (UGLS), bring one concrete change from your context, and we can walk through the lifecycle and see where the trail holds and where it breaks.
