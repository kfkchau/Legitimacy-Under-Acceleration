## DRAFT - The City We’re Actually Governing with AI

Most AI governance talk lives in documents:

- principles, risk classes, and impact assessments  
- obligations for providers and deployers  
- audits, evaluations, certifications  

That’s the **rule side** of the story.

But if you ask the people living under these systems – workers, professionals, founders, citizens – they don’t experience “AI governance” as a PDF.

They experience:

- which **paths** through work and life are still open  
- which roles still feel meaningful  
- what kinds of effort still “count”

That’s the **value side**. And AI is rewiring both at once.

This is the city we’re actually governing, whether we admit it or not.

## Rules: the traffic system of the city

Start with the familiar half.

One side of the city is built out of **rules** – the traffic system of social life:

- laws and regulations  
- policies and standards  
- procedures, guidance and professional codes  
- the unwritten norms everyone “just knows”

Institutions are the places that host and operate this machinery:

- parliaments, ministries and regulators  
- courts and tribunals  
- companies and boards  
- standards bodies, industry groups, unions  
- universities and professional associations

Together, they form an **ecosystem of governance mechanisms**:

- how rules are made  
- how they’re interpreted  
- how they’re enforced  
- how they change (or don’t)  
- how they’re explained when people push back

This is the part most AI frameworks try to address:

- UNESCO / OECD principles  
- NIST RMF, ISO/IEC 42001  
- the EU AI Act  
- corporate “Responsible AI” guidelines  

They’re mostly traffic-code work: deciding what’s allowed at the junction.

Important. Necessary. But not the whole city.

## Routes: the value side we almost never talk about

The other side of the city is built out of **value**.

People constantly make judgements about what matters:

- which work deserves respect  
- which products and services are worth paying for  
- which careers feel meaningful  
- which futures feel worth aiming at

In the city, that shows up as the **routes people actually drive**:

- routines and commutes they stick to  
- neighbourhoods that fill up  
- areas they quietly avoid  
- shortcuts, detours, and side-streets that only locals know

Those everyday route choices stand in for **value signals** – all the ways the world tells us what is “worth it”:

- salaries and prices  
- promotions, titles and bonuses  
- rankings, likes, invitations  
- subtle status and reputation

Markets compress those judgements into numbers.  
The wider economy takes those signals and feeds them back into people’s lives:

- what gets funded  
- which jobs are attractive  
- what feels like success or failure  

Most of this never appears in a regulation. But it determines whether people experience a system as **liveable and fair**, or as something they’re just surviving.

## AI is changing both – and our governance only looks at one

Acceleration isn’t just “faster tech”. It’s:

- faster **information flow**  
- faster **coordination**  
- faster **feedback loops** – social, economic, political  

AI sits right in the middle of that.

On the **rule side**, we’re adding:

- new principles and codes  
- new obligations and reporting  
- new oversight committees  
- new risk categories for AI systems

On the **value side**, AI is quietly changing:

- which tasks humans still perform  
- which skills are rewarded  
- which roles become structurally fragile

People use their work to answer:

- *What am I actually good at?*  
- *What do people rely on me for?*  
- *What kind of life am I building here?*

When AI moves into the parts of work people were proud of – writing, analysing, diagnosing, coordinating, designing – the **routes** through the city change:

- some career paths thin out or disappear  
- others become overcrowded and precarious  
- new paths appear that aren’t yet recognised or rewarded  

You can end up with a situation where:

- the **traffic system** looks “safe and compliant” on paper  
- but people feel like there are fewer meaningful journeys left for them to make

That’s not just a labour-market problem. It’s a **legitimacy problem**.

## Why a rule-only view of AI governance isn’t enough

Most AI governance work today sits almost entirely on the **rule side**:

- defining risk levels and prohibited uses  
- specifying documentation and assessments  
- adding controls and approvals  

All necessary. None of it wrong.

The problem is what’s *missing*:

1. **No clear view of how rules meet actual workflows**  
   - How is this rule wired into:
     - tasks,  
     - roles,  
     - tools,  
     - logs,  
     - escalation paths?  
   - Can a person under the system explain:
     - *“Who decided this, under which rule, and who could have stopped it?”*

2. **No visibility into what happens to human routes**  
   - As AI rolls out, are there still:
     - meaningful paths for people to grow?  
     - visible ways to contribute and be recognised?  
   - Or are we silently:
     - hollowing out roles,  
     - turning professionals into supervisors of systems they don’t believe in,  
     - pushing valuable work (care, mentoring, glue work) off the metrics?

3. **No language for the interaction between rules and value**  
   - When value signals move faster than rule systems can adapt, people route around rules.  
   - When rules move faster than shared understanding and value, they feel imposed and arbitrary.

If AI governance stays “rule-only”, it will miss where legitimacy is actually leaking.

## Thinking in terms of a governance–economic system

I find it more honest to talk about a **governance–economic system**:

- **Rule layer**  
  How we structure, constrain and contest decisions:
  - laws, policies, standards, procedures, escalation rules.

- **Value layer**  
  How effort, contribution and risk are recognised and rewarded:
  - pay, status, opportunity, voice.

Under AI acceleration, these two layers are colliding:

- rules are being adapted to fit AI systems  
- AI systems are reshaping which kinds of work and judgement still “count”

If you only look at one layer, you get blindsided by the other.

A technically compliant AI rollout that:

- erodes meaningful work,  
- hides whole categories of contribution,  
- or quietly shuts down paths people relied on  

…is still a governance failure, even if every box on the checklist is ticked.

## What Legitimacy Under Acceleration is trying to do

Under *Legitimacy Under Acceleration*, I’m treating this city picture as a design constraint, not just a metaphor.

For me, that means working on both sides at once:

- **On the rule side**  
  Designing governance architectures that:
  - can be wired into real workflows,  
  - can change under pressure without collapsing,  
  - and leave trails people can understand and challenge.

  (Task-boundary work, meta-governance “kernels”, governance-first orchestration.)

- **On the value side**  
  Facing the fact that:
  - people’s sources of self-worth will have to change,  
  - old career routes won’t be the centre forever,  
  and asking:
  - how do we support new forms of contribution, recognition and meaning  
    when AI takes over the tasks people once used to answer  
    *“what am I good for here?”*

I’m not claiming to have all the answers. What I’m trying to do is hold both halves of the city in view when we talk about “AI governance”.

Because every time we say that phrase, we should be able to point to:

- a **traffic rule** that changed, *and*  
- a **human route** that stayed open or became possible

If we can’t, then we’re not really governing the system –  
we’re just adding more signs to a junction people no longer know how to cross.

If this way of looking at AI governance resonates – especially if you’re working on RAIO, architecture, policy, or you’re living through these shifts in your own profession – I’m building out this work under *Legitimacy Under Acceleration*.

Happy to be in conversation with others who are trying to keep both **rules** and **routes** in view.
